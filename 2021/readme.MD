My first year completing the Advent of Code in December! It was a lot of fun. Some highlights and lowlights:
- My first points! I got 24 points for Part 1 of Dec 23, which I completed in just over 12 minutes. No code since I completed day 23 by hand. I also would have completed day 23 before I went to bed, but I simply got too tired.
- Small children occasionally get in the way of completing these, so day 19 was completed in about 25 hours.
- After feeling guilty about doing day 23 by hand, I decided to try and code my way through day 24. Ironically, this problem was better tackled by hand. It was also the only day I threw in the towel after 24 hours and looked up the solution.
- A few problems were simply brute-forced (like day 15) while others were only barely optimized (like day 22)
